Looking at the frequency of each Hangul syllabic block

My Hangul frequency project aims to visualize the relative frequency of Hangul syllabic blocks. Frequency is calculated from a single corpus of data, the Korean Contemporary Corpus of Written Sentences, which I downloaded from <http://nlp.kookmin.ac.kr/kcc/>.

I've kept my first attempt (filename hangulFreq.html), which simply displays a table of all possible syllabic blocks and colors the background of each block according to the block's relative frequency. A white background signifies a frequency of 0, while a red (FF0000) background signifies the most common syllabic block in the dataset, ë‹¤. Specifically, the color of the background is determined by setting the green and blue values to decrease linearly with increased relative frequency of the syllabic block.

It turns out, however, that a linear association does not produce a good visualization. In hangulFreq2.html, the color value scale corresponds to the logarithm of the relative frequency of a syllabic block, which produces a better visualization. The user can toggle between a color scale from black to white for high to low frequency, and red to blue for high to low frequency, using a switch in the upper right-hand corner of the page. Clicking on a syllabic block will generate an informational box to the right giving more details about the syllabic block and its occurrences in the data.
